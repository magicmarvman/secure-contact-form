## Requirements
Please replace the links to external libraries in `form.html` with corresponding links to a CDN or self-downloaded files.

The following libraries are required:
* PHP 8.0 or later (for the example handler, any script can be used that takes the POST parameters and sends them as an e-mail, for example)
* [OpenPGP.js](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/start) (optional, for icons)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) (optional, but the design is written with classes for Bootstrap)
